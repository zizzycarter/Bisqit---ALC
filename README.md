# Budgit!---ALC
A single screen android app that help students create a budget based on their monthly allowance. Created by a team of 4 during a 2 hours hackathon to wrap up the Andela Android learning Community Beginner's track programme sponsored by Google and Udacity. 

The percentages allocated activities (feeding, clothing etc.) was got based on a student survey online.

Budgit! was created for fun, it is not a live app and it bares no affilation with already existing applications named as such.
